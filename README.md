# Robot Control System with ROS and OpenCV

## Description
This repository contains a Python implementation for a robot control system using ROS (Robot Operating System) and OpenCV. The robot is programmed to detect and follow an object using computer vision techniques.

The main script processes images from a camera to detect an object and adjusts the robot's movements accordingly to follow it. This setup leverages ROS for communication and control and OpenCV for image processing.
