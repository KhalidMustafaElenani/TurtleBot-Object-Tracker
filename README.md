# Robot Control System with ROS-2 and OpenCV

## Description
This repository contains a Python implementation for a robot control system using ROS (Robot Operating System) and OpenCV. The robot is programmed to detect and follow an object using computer vision techniques.

The main script processes images from a camera to detect an object and adjusts the robot's movements accordingly to follow it. This setup leverages ROS for communication and control and OpenCV for image processing.

  2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd robot-control-system`
     
## Code Overview
**`Robot_Control_Script.py`**: 
  - Uses OpenCV to process images and detect objects.
  - Uses ROS to control the robot based on object detection.
